### I am the owner of Nasulex. ( A game server host and gaming community ) 
Our steam group: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/nasulex <br>
Discord: https://nasulex.net/discord<br>
Website: https://nasulex.net

Some of my interests:
* Networking
* Virtualization & containerization
* Programming ( Network applications are cool ) 
* Interacting with people and having fun. 
* Hosting game servers. 
* .....

### Future plan for this github:

You can expect to see anything here that I think would benifit the open source community. This could be future projects involving stuff related to game servers etc. 

As always thanks for reading! Have great day or night.
