### Hello and welcome to my github
<img src="./particle.webp">

### I am the owner of Nasulex. ( A game server host )
Discord: https://nasulex.net/discord<br>
Website: https://nasulex.net

### I also run a gaming community called Laid Back Gaming:
A gaming community with the goal of being exactly like its name.<br>
Steam: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/lb_gamers<br>
Discord: https://discord.gg/lbg<br>

Some of my interests:
* Networking
* Virtualization & containerization
* Programming ( Network applications are cool ) 
* Interacting with people and having fun. 
* Hosting game servers. 
* .....

### Future plan for this github:

You can expect to see anything here that I think would benifit the open source community. This could be future projects involving stuff related to game servers etc. 

As always thanks for reading! Have great day or night.
